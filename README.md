### An Introduction to Loseronics 

## _What is Loseronics?_
Loseronics is a community project of mine that seeks to simplify and explain the [Socionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics) psychological types theory proposed by the Lithuanian psychologist [Aušra Augustinavičiūtė](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au%C5%A1ra_Augustinavi%C4%8Di%C5%ABt%C4%97)
There is no reason for the name "Loseronics", I find it appealing and I'm probably keeping that way until I find a better name.
