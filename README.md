# An Introduction to Loseronics 
_An organized structured way of learning_  
  
## _What is Loseronics?_
Loseronics is a community project of mine that seeks to simplify and explain the [Socionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics) psychological types theory proposed by the Lithuanian psychologist [Aušra Augustinavičiūtė](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au%C5%A1ra_Augustinavi%C4%8Di%C5%ABt%C4%97).  
The Loseronics project seeks to create a beginner-friendly organized learning environment with reliable sources and explanations so people won't get that confused when getting into Socionics, being able to open up a page on this site whenever they have a doubt.  
There is no reason for the name "Loseronics", I find it appealing and I'm probably keeping that way until I find a better name.
